PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES

- DONT REPEAT YOURSELF
- MAKE CONSTANT USE OF HELPER FUNCTIONS AND MAKE VERY SMALL AND SPECIFIC USE FOR EACH FUNCTION 
- SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PER CLASS AND FUNCTION, SPECIFIC AND SMALL 
- EACH CLASS IS RESPONSIBLE ONLY IN ITSELF TO CHANGE STATE OR EXPOSE VARIABLES USE SIGNALS AND SET/GET 
- SIGNAL UP, CALL DOWN. HAVE A SINGLE ROOT MASTER THAT HANDLES INTER-CLASS INTERACTION AND FUNCTIONALITY 
- REMEMBER TO ONLY DO LOOSE COUPLING OR DEPENDENCY INJECTION USING SET/GET AND HELPER FUNCTIONS
- AGAIN EACH CLASS IS RESPONSIBLE ONLY FOR ITS OWN STATE. IT CHANGES ONLY VALUES INSIDE ITSELF AND NOTHING OUTSIDE OF IT BUT CAN READ VALUES FROM OUTSIDE OF IT THROUGH SIGNALS OR THROUGH MASTER ROOT NODE
